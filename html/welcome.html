                        To start using this extension, you can click on the extension icon with<span class="important">right mouse button</span> and then choose <span class="important">options</span>. On the options page, you will be able to choose coins that you want to track, the currency in which you want to see coin price and to set price alerts for any available coin.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        To set price alert, simply click on bell icon and then you will be able to set a price alert for that coin. You can only choose between BTC and FIAT currency that you have selected (USD by default).
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        So, let's say that you put price alert on Bitcoin to warn you if it goes above 8000 USD. Later you change your FIAT currency to EUR and your alert is now 8000 EUR instead of 8000 USD. If you don't want to use one field when setting alert, leave that field empty.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Coin prices that are displayed in BTC are set to 8 digits after the decimal point. If coin price is less than a 1, it will be fixed to 8 digits after the decimal point. Otherwise it will be fixed to 4 digits after the decimal point.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        You can change colors for a popup window by clicking on the extension icon with the <span class="important">right mouse button</span> and choosing "Change colors" option.
                    </p>
