                        <li>This update brings some performance optimizations under the hood. Code is now organized differently in preparation for another update that will be necessary for this and other extensions to be available on Chrome store in the future.</li>

                        <li>On Options page, you can see three new buttons. It was suggested a long time ago by few a users, but we were not able to implement it back then. Now you can use those buttons to easily switch only to coins that you have selected and coins that you have set price alert for.</li>
                        <li>Be aware that because of some code changes, there may be some issues even though everything is tested before publishing.
